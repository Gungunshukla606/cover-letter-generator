#Cover-Letter-Generator
While developing this project, I asked AI for guidance on creating a basic HTML form for user input fields such as name, role, company, and skills. 
I requested help with CSS styling to design a clean and readable interface. 
I also asked for JavaScript logic to capture form data and generate a template-based cover letter.
Additional prompts were used to implement a copy-to-clipboard feature and improve layout structure.
AI tools like ChatGPT were used as learning support to understand concepts and refine the code during development.
